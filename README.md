## Overview

Base module for configuring my muppets. Works with AMD64 Debian and
Ubuntu, and armv7l Debian (i.e. Raspbian for Raspbery Pis).

## Module Description

The module sets up APT repos, installs common packages, sets up sudo and adds users.

## Limitations

It works for me.  It probably won't work for you.
